We have become more “social” pushed by the media such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. We are sharing and retweeting as one of the daily interactions.

"Share" originally means cutting or division. But we are not sharing in that context on the web. But rather we simply copy, paste the information, and sends that to the web hoping people will look at it. Only when other people recognize it, the act of share will be accomplished.

To maintain the original concept of sharing on the web, I built the Sweesaw toy that lets multiple people control with their phone. Each tilt of user's phone affects the angle of the seasaw toy which sits in physical space. For the final presentation, I called my friend in Portland, then let him play the seesaw. He was there without being there.

Project 1: Genetic Conversations
This project propose the possibility to stablish a musical dialogue between two living beings trough their DNA. 
The DNA images come from electrophoresis technique used in molecular biology.
I take this PCR images from DNA samples and converted them into a paper piano roll to play it in a music box.
The concept behind is about despite of our differences we can have a conversation with an elephant or bacteria or another human being, trough sound.

Project 2: Haikus made of song titles
Is an automatic generator of poems based on a data base of song titles and artist names.
